# HTML-CSS-Portfolio
Creating a simple portfolio in Html and Css

Today I just start to make a simple portfolio with html and css. I expected it will attractive for users IA.

Untill now I make header for the portolio. In header first I h2 for header's name and navigation links to navigate to different webpages of the portfolio such Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

After this I start with css designing. first i make universal selector and give it margin and padding value. Then  I give some property to body in which design the grid-template area.

After This I design the header section with flexbox layouts and give border-bottom to distinguish from hero section.


Updating the Html-Css-Portfolio, in which I added the Hero Section (Intro Section), and added the Skills Section.

And also make it's a little responsiveness with grid.
